Input

The first line of input contains one integer, giving the number of operations to perform.

Then follow the operations, one per line, each of the form 𝑥1 𝑦1 op 𝑥2 𝑦2. Here, −109≤𝑥1,𝑦1,𝑥2,𝑦2<109 are integers, indicating that the operands are 𝑥1/𝑦1 and 𝑥2/𝑦2. The operator op is one of ’+’, ’−’, ’∗’, ’/’, indicating which operation to perform.

You may assume that 𝑦1≠0, 𝑦2≠0, and that 𝑥2≠0 for division operations.

Output

For each operation in each test case, output the result of performing the indicated operation, in shortest terms, in the form indicated.

Sample Input 1              Sample Output 1
4                           5 / 6
1 3 + 1 2                   -1 / 6
1 3 - 1 2                   -82 / 189
123 287 / 81 -82            -4 / 1
12 -3 * -1 -1
