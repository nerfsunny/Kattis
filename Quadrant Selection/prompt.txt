A common problem in mathematics is to determine which quadrant a given point lies in. There are four quadrants, numbered from 1 to 4, as shown in the diagram below:

DIAGRAM N/A

For example, the point 𝐴, which is at coordinates (12,5) lies in quadrant 1 since both its 𝑥 and 𝑦 values are positive, and point 𝐵 lies in quadrant 2 since its 𝑥 value is negative and its 𝑦 value is positive.

Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant it is in. You can assume that neither of the two coordinates will be 0.

Input

The first line of input contains the integer 𝑥 (−100 0≤ 𝑥 ≤1000; 𝑥 ≠ 0). The second line of input contains the integer 𝑦 (−1000 ≤ 𝑦 ≤ 1000; 𝑦 ≠ 0).

Output

Output the quadrant number (1, 2, 3 or 4) for the point (𝑥,𝑦).
