Theta has been learning about powers of 2 in school. She notices that some numbers when written out contain powers of 2 in their digit representation: for instance, 12560 contains 256 which is a power of 2. She has been wondering how many such numbers there are.

Can you write a program that counts how many numbers contain a given power of 2?

Input (Easy)

The input consists of a single line with two integers 𝑛 and 𝑒 (0≤𝑛≤15000000,0≤𝑒≤25).

Input (Hard)

The input consists of a single line with two integers 𝑛 and 𝑒 (0≤𝑛≤9⋅1018,0≤𝑒≤62).

Output

Output a single integer that is equal to the number of distinct integers 𝑘 (0 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛) whose decimal representation contains the digits of 2^𝑒 as a substring.

Sample Input 1               Sample Output 1

1000000 5                    49401

Sample Input 3               Sample Output 3
1000000 16                   20

Sample Input 4 (Hard)        Sample Output 4
9000000000000000000 62       1

Sample Input 5 (Hard)        Sample Output 5
5432123456789876543 33       20
