In order to become the very best Pokenom trainer, Bash needs to prepare a team of Pokenom to participate in the Pokenom world championship.

Bash has 𝑁 Pokenoms. Each Pokenom has 3 stats: Attack, Defense and Health. Bash wants to select 𝐾 Pokenoms with highest attack, 𝐾 Pokenoms with highest defense and 𝐾 Pokenoms with highest Health.

After selection, Bash found something strange: his team have less than 3×𝐾 Pokenoms!

Bash looks carefully at 𝑁=4 Pokenoms he has:
    ‘Chikapu’: Attack = 100, Defense = 100, Health = 100
    ‘Batterfly’: Attack = 10, Defense = 10, Health = 10
    ‘Mewthree’: Attack = 200, Defense = 200, Health = 80
    ‘Dragonon’: Attack = 150, Defense = 150, Health = 90

When Bash selects Pokenom with 𝐾=1, only ‘Mewthree’ and ‘Chikapu’ are selected! This is because ‘Mewthree’ has highest attack and highest defense!

When Bash selects Pokenom with 𝐾=1, only ‘Mewthree’ and ‘Chikapu’ are selected! This is because ‘Mewthree’ has highest attack and highest defense!

Input

The first line of input contains 2 integers 𝑁 and 𝐾 (1≤𝐾≤𝑁≤1000).

In the next 𝑁 lines, the 𝑖-th line contains 3 integers: 𝐴𝑖, 𝐷𝑖 and 𝐻𝑖, representing the 3 stats of the 𝑖-th Pokenom. 𝐴𝑖, 𝐷𝑖 and 𝐻𝑖 are unsigned 32-bit integers.

It is guaranteed that no 2 Pokenom have same Attack, no 2 Pokenom have same Defense, and no 2 Pokenoms have same Health.

Output

Output one line containing exactly one integer: the number of Pokenom in Bash’s team.

Sample Input 1     Sample Output 1
4 1                2
100 100 100
10 10 10
200 200 80
150 150 90
