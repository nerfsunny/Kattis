We say that 洧논 is a perfect square if, for some integer 洧녪, 洧논=洧녪2. Similarly, 洧논 is a perfect cube if, for some integer 洧녪, 洧논=洧녪3. More generally, 洧논 is a perfect 洧녷th power if, for some integer 洧녪, 洧논=洧녪洧녷. Given an integer 洧논 you are to determine the largest integer 洧녷 such that 洧논 is a perfect 洧녷th power.

Input

Each test case is given by a line of input containing 洧논. The value of 洧논 will have magnitude at least 2 and be within the range of a (32-bit) int in C, C++, and Java. A line containing 0 follows the last test case.

Output

For each test case, output a line giving the largest integer 洧녷 such that 洧논 is a perfect 洧녷th power.
