RILEY VASHTEE: [reading from display] Find the next number in the sequence:

313 331 367 ...? What?

THE DOCTOR: 379.

MARTHA JONES: What?

THE DOCTOR: It’s a sequence of happy primes – 379.

MARTHA JONES: Happy what?

THE DOCTOR: Any number that reduces to one when you take the sum of the square of its digits and continue iterating it until it yields 1 is a happy number. Any number that doesn’t, isn’t. A happy prime is both happy and prime.

THE DOCTOR: I dunno, talk about dumbing down. Don’t they teach recreational mathematics anymore?

Excerpted from “Dr. Who,” Episode 42 (2007).

The number 7 is certainly prime. But is it happy?

	7 → 7^2 = 49
	49 → 4^2 + 9^2 = 97
	97 → 9^2 + 7^2 = 130
	130 → 1^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 = 10
	10 → 1^2 + 0^2 = 1

It is happy :-) As it happens, 7 is the smallest happy prime. Please note that for the purposes of this problem, 1 is not prime.

For this problem you will write a program to determine if a number is a happy prime.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer 𝑃, (1≤𝑃≤10000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed identically and independently.

Each data set consists of a single line of input. It contains the data set number, 𝐾, followed by the happy prime candidate, 𝑚, (1≤𝑚≤10000).

Output

For each data set there is a single line of output. The single output line consists of the data set number, 𝐾, followed by a single space followed by the candidate, 𝑚, followed by a single space, followed by YES or NO, indicating whether 𝑚 is a happy prime.

Sample Input 1          Sample Output 1
4                       1 1 NO
1 1                     2 7 YES
2 7                     3 383 YES
3 383                   4 1000 NO
4 1000
