The coach of Nha Trang University, Mr. Van, has just organized a contest to form its ICPC teams. There were students participating in the contest. The 𝑖th student scored 𝑃𝑖 in the contest.

The coach wants to form 𝑁 different teams (each team has 3 students) to take part in the regional contest based on the results from this contest. In his experience, the performance of a team is usually equal to the median of team members’ individual results (i.e. the result of the second-best student).

The coach wants to maximize 𝑆 – the sum of his 𝑁 teams’ performance. Your task is to calculate 𝑆.

Input

The input consists of several datasets. The first line of the input contains the number of datasets which is a positive integer and is not greater than 20. The following lines describe the datasets.

Each dataset is described by the following lines:
	The first line contains a positive integer 𝑁 (𝑁≤100)
	The second line contains 3𝑁 positive integers 𝑃1,𝑃2,…,𝑃3𝑁 (𝑃𝑖≤100).

Output

For each dataset, output the value 𝑆.

Explanation for the Sample Dataset

One way to form two teams is:
	Team 1: student 1, student 2, student 3
	Team 2: student 4, student 5, student 6
