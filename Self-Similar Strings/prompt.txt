An object is sometimes called ‘self-similar’ if there are parts of it that are repeated in other places within the same object. Fractals are self-similar mathematical objects, where the similarities occur at different sizes.

Here, we’ll consider ‘self-similar strings.’ We’ll say that a string 𝑠 is self-similar to degree 𝑑 if all 𝑑-length substrings of 𝑠 occur in at least one other location in 𝑠. For example, the string ‘babbabb’ is self-similar to degree 0, degree 1, and degree 2. It is not self-similar to any greater degree. It should be clear that 𝑑≤|𝑠|−1.

Write a program which determines the largest degree of self-similarity for given strings.

Input

Input is a list of up to 10000 strings, one per line. Each string is made of up to 80 lower-case alphabet characters (a-z). Input ends at the end of file.

Output

For each string, print the largest degree to which the string is self-similar.

Sample input 1               Sample Output 1
abcdefg                      0
aaaaaa                       5
bababab                      4
aaabbbccc                    1
