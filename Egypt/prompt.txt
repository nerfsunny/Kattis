A long time ago, the Egyptians figured out that a triangle with sides of length 3, 4, and 5 had a right angle as its largest angle. You must determine if other triangles have a similar property.

Input

Input represents several test cases (at most 1000), followed by a line containing 0 0 0. Each test case has three positive integers, at most 30000, denoting the lengths of the sides of a triangle.

Output

For each test case, a line containing “right” if the triangle is a right triangle, and a line containing “wrong” if the triangle is not a right triangle.

Sample Input 1               Sample Output 1
6 8 10                       right
25 52 60                     wrong
5 12 13                      right
0 0 0
