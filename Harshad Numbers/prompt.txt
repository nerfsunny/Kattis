We’re all familiar with harshad numbers. For this problem, you will ... what’s that? You aren’t familiar with harshad numbers? They’re also known as Niven numbers – does that ring a bell?? Anything???

Well, it’s a simple enough concept. A harshad number is a number which is evenly divisible by the sum of its digits. For example, 24 is a harshad number: the sum of its digits is 2+4=6 and 24 is divisible by 6. 156 is also a harshad number, since 1+5+6=12 and 156=(12)(13). 157 is NOT a harshad number since it is not divisible by 1+5+7=13.

OK, let’s start over.

We’re all familiar with harshad numbers. For this problem, you will be given a number 𝑛 and must find the smallest harshad number ≥𝑛.

Input

Input consists of a single line containing a positive integer 𝑛≤1000000000.

Output

Display the smallest harshad number greater than or equal to 𝑛.
