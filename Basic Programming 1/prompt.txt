You think you can code?
This problem will test you on various basic programming techniques.
You are given two integers 𝑁 and 𝑡; and then an array 𝐴 of 𝑁 integers (0-based indexing).
Based on the value of 𝑡, you will perform an action on 𝐴.

t | Action Needed 
  |
1 | Print 7, regardless of the content of 𝐴
  |
2 | Print “Bigger” if 𝐴[0]>𝐴[1], or
  | Print “Equal” if 𝐴[0]==𝐴[1], or
  | Print “Smaller” otherwise (without the quotes); 
  | Ignore other indices of 𝐴, if any
3 | Print the median of three integers {𝐴[0], 𝐴[1], and 𝐴[2]};
  | Ignore other indices of 𝐴, if any
4 | Print the sum of all integers in 𝐴
  |
5 | Print the sum of all even integers in 𝐴
  |
6 | Apply modulo (%) 26 to each integer in 𝐴,
  | Map integer 0/1/…/25 to character ‘a’/‘b’/…/‘z’,
  | Finally, print the sequence of characters as a string (without the spaces)
  |
7 | a. Start from index 𝑖=0;
  | b. Jump to index 𝑖=𝐴[𝑖];
  | c. If the current index 𝑖 is outside the valid bound of [0..𝑁-1], print “Out” and stop;
  | d. Else if the current index 𝑖 is index 𝑁-1, print “Done” and stop;
  | e1. Otherwise, repeat step b;
  | e2. If doing this leads to an infinite loop, print “Cyclic” and stop;
  | (all output are without the quotes)

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑁 and 𝑡 (3≤𝑁≤200000; 1≤𝑡≤7).
The second line of the input contains 𝑁 non-negative 32-bit signed integers.

Output

For each test case, output the required answer based on the value of 𝑡.

Scoring

There are 20 hidden test cases that test various requirements of this problem.
All 20 test cases will be tested.
Each hidden test case worth 5 points (the 7 sample test cases below worth 0 point).
