Consider a positive integer 𝑥. Multiply its nonzero digits and you get another integer 𝑦. Repeating this process, you eventually arrive at a single digit between 1 and 9. Write a program that reads 𝑥 and outputs the resulting digit.

Input

An integer 𝑥 with 10≤𝑥≤1000.

Output 

Print a digit between 1 and 9, the result of repeatedly multiplying the nonzero digits of 𝑥 as described above.

Explanation of Sample Inputs

In Sample Input 1, we have 𝑥=808. Multiplying 8 and 8, we arrive at 64. Then we get 6⋅4=24, and finally 2⋅4=8, which is the sample output.

In Sample Input 2, there is only a single nonzero digit, 2. The product of all digits in a set containing only a single element is the digit itself. Thus the answer is 2.

Sample Input 1     Sample Output 1
808                8

Sample Input 2     Sample Output 2
2                  2
