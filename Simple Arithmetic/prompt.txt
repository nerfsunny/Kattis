You are given three integers 𝑎,𝑏,𝑐 (1≤𝑎,𝑏,𝑐≤10^9). Compute 𝑎⋅𝑏/𝑐, with an absolute precision of 10^−6.

Input

The first and only line of input contains the three integers 𝑎,𝑏,𝑐 separated by a single space.

Output

Output a single floating point number. It must differ from 𝑎⋅𝑏/𝑐 by at most 10^−6 in absolute value, i.e., it should obey |𝑥−𝑎⋅𝑏/𝑐|≤10^−6.

Constraints

Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each worth a number of points. Each test group contains a set of test cases. To get the points for a test group you need to solve all test cases in the test group. Your final score will be the maximum score of a single submission.

1 | 25 Points | 1≤𝑎,𝑏,𝑐≤10
2 | 25 Points | 1≤𝑎,𝑏,𝑐≤10000
3 | 25 Points | 1≤𝑎,𝑏≤10^9,𝑐=1
4 | 25 Points | 1≤𝑎,𝑏,𝑐≤10^9
