While learning mathematics at school, Hieu amazingly invented a new sequence of numbers. It can be defined as below:

𝐴1 =1 
𝐴𝑖 = 𝐴_(𝑖−1) + 𝑠𝑜𝑑(𝐴_(𝑖−1))

Here 𝑠𝑜𝑑(𝑋) is the sum of digits of 𝑋 (in base 10)

The first few elements of sequence 𝐴 is [1,2,4,8,16,23,28,38,49,62,70,77,91,…]. Hieu also researched on its cumulative sums. The cumulative sums 𝑆 of the sequence 𝐴 is defined as:

𝑆_𝑖 = ∑^i _(j = 1) = 𝐴𝑗
