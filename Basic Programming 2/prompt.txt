You think you can code?
This problem will test you on various basic programming techniques.
You are given two integers 𝑁 and 𝑡; and then an array 𝐴 of 𝑁 integers (0-based indexing).
Based on the value of 𝑡, you will perform an action on 𝐴.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer 𝑁 and 𝑡 (3≤𝑁≤200000; 1≤𝑡≤5).
The second line of the input contains 𝑁 non-negative 32-bit signed integers.

Output

For each test case, output the required answer based on the value of 𝑡.

Scoring

There are 20 hidden test cases that test various requirements of this problem.
All 20 test cases will be tested.
Each hidden test case worth 5 points (the 5 sample test cases below worth 0 point).
