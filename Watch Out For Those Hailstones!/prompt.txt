An interesting theory in mathematics is that there is a sequence generator that, given any positive integer as the starting point, always ends with the number 1. Although this theory has never been proven, the conjecture is known as the Collatz Conjecture (named after Lothar Collatz, who posed the idea in 1937). Given an integer, 𝑛⩾1, this conjecture pertains to the sequence ℎ(𝑛), which we recursively define as follows:
	If 𝑛=1, the sequence is composed of a single integer: 1
	If 𝑛 is even, the sequence is composed of 𝑛 followed by sequence ℎ(𝑛/2)
	If 𝑛 is odd, the sequence is composed of 𝑛 followed by sequence ℎ(3⋅𝑛+1)

For example, the following are the sequences for the numbers 5 and 7:
	ℎ(5)=(5,16,8,4,2,1)
	ℎ(7)=(7,22,11,34,17,52,26,13,40,20,10,5,16,8,4,2,1)

The ℎ(𝑛) sequence is commonly known as the hailstone sequence, because of its nature of going up and down like a hailstone in a cloud before eventually falling to Earth. In this problem, you will calculate the sum of all the values in a hailstone sequence. Using the sequences above, the sum of ℎ(5) is 36 and the sum of ℎ(7) is 288.

Your solution must use a RECURSIVE function,
based on the recursive definition of ℎ(𝑛) presented above.

On the exam, any other type of solution will receive zero points!

EVEN IF KATTIS JUDGES IT AS CORRECT!

Note: You are allowed to add up the numbers iteratively, as long as the ℎ(𝑛) sequence is computed recursively.

Input

The input contains a single positive integer, 𝑛 (0<𝑛⩽2^32−1).

Output

The output contains a single integer: the sum of all the values in ℎ(𝑛). You may assume that this sum will fit in an unsigned 64-bit integer.

Sample Input 1          Sample Output 1
5                       36

Sample Input 2          Sample Output 2
7                       288
