Given 𝑁 integers in the range [−50000,50000], how many ways are there to pick three integers 𝑎𝑖, 𝑎𝑗, 𝑎𝑘, such that 𝑖, 𝑗, 𝑘 are pairwise distinct and 𝑎𝑖 + 𝑎𝑗 =𝑎k? Two ways are different if they’re ordered triples (𝑖,𝑗,𝑘) of indices are different.

Input

The first line of input consists of a single integer 𝑁
(1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 200000). The next line consists of 𝑁 space-separated integers 𝑎₁, 𝑎₂, …, 𝑎𝑁.

Input

Output an integer representing the number of ways.

Output

Output an integer representing the number of ways.
